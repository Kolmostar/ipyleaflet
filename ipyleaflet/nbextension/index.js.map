If\n *   the event is canceled, the indicated drop action is returned to\n *   the initiator through the resolved promise.\n *\n * A drag operation can be terminated at any time by pressing `Escape`\n * or by disposing the drag object.\n *\n * A drag object has the ability to automatically scroll a scrollable\n * element when the mouse is hovered near one of its edges.
